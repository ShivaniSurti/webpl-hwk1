        <h4>Peacocks in Hinduism</h4>
        <p>The peafowl is native to India and significant in its culture. In Hinduism, the Indian peacock is the mount
            of the god of war, Lord Kartikeya, and the warrior goddess Kaumari, and is also depicted around the goddess
            Santoshi.[31] During a war with Asuras, Kartikeya split the demon king Surapadman in half. Out of respect
            for his adversary's prowess in battle, the god converted the two halves into an integral part of himself.
            One half became a peacock serving as his mount, and the other a rooster adorning his flag. The peacock
            displays the divine shape of Omkara when it spreads its magnificent plumes into a full-blown circular
            form.[32] Peacock feathers also adorn the crest of Lord Krishna, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, one of the
            trimurti.</p>

        <h4>Peacocks in Greece</h4>
        <p>Ancient Greeks believed that the flesh of peafowl did not decay after death, so it became a symbol of
            immortality. In Hellenistic imagery, the Greek goddess Hera's chariot was pulled by peacocks, birds not
            known to Greeks before the conquests of Alexander. Alexander's tutor, Aristotle, refers to it as "the
            Persian bird". When Alexander saw the birds in India, he was so amazed at their beauty that he threatened
            the severest penalties for any man who slew one. Claudius Aelianus writes that there were peacocks in India,
            larger than anywhere else.</p>
