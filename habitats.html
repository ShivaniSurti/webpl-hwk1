        <h2>Habitats</h2>
        <p> Peacocks prefer to inhabit low-landing forests. They are found in both dry and tropical habitats. Peacocks
            are also
            often found in agricultural field as well as farms. They tend to prefer low-landing forests since it is
            easier to gather
            food.

        <h4>Peacocks in Southeast India</h4>
        <p>The green peafowl was widely distributed in Southeast Asia in the past from eastern
            and north-eastern India, northern Myanmar, and southern China, extending through Laos,
            and Thailand into Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, and the islands of Java. Records
            from northeastern India have been questioned and old records are possibly of feral birds.
            The ranges have reduced with habitat destruction and hunting.</p>
