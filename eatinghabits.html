            <h2>General Information</h2>

            <p>Peacocks generally are not picky eaters. Their diet is heavily influenced by the environment they are in and the season. They have a heavy plant-based diet that depends on the foliage available to them.

            <h4>Omnivores</h4>
            <p>It may come as surprise to some that peacocks are actually omnivores. Along with plants, they eat insects and other arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians. They also tend to attack snakes and other animals that might pose a threat to them.

                <h4>Timings</h4>
                <p>Wild peafowl look for their food scratching around in leaf litter either early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat to the shade and security of the woods for the hottest portion of the day.

                <h4>Domesticated Peacocks</h4>
                <p>Domesticated peafowl may also eat bread and cracked grain such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice and sometimes cat food. It has been noticed by keepers that peafowl enjoy protein-rich food including larvae that infest granaries, different kinds of meat and fruit, as well as vegetables including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and peas.
